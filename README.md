# Stripes Training Companion App

This Jiu Jitsu Training Companion App is designed to support students on their Jiu Jitsu journey, focusing on the FightTLV training method. It offers video lessons, descriptions, progress tracking, and social interactions with coaches and other students.

## Usage

Upon launching the app, students can access lesson material for each stripe in their belt, view instructional videos and descriptions for moves and positions, and track their progress. They can log notes from training sessions, bookmark and save material for quick reference, and interact with coaches and other students through comments and questions on the video.

Coaches can upload weekly course material and gym announcements, ensuring students stay up to date with their training program. In the future, the app will have the capacity to serve as a platform for other gyms to host their training material for their students.
